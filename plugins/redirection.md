# Redirection

Vendi uses the [Redirection](https://wordpress.org/plugins/redirection/) to manage redirections (301/302), vanity URLs and 404s.

## Features
 * Import from other redirection plugins
 * Export to Apache/Nginx
 * Grouping of redirects for organization purposes
 * Many pre-conditions including headers, login status and IP address
 * Full logging, including last-usage
 * Query parameter handling

## Price
Free

## Alternatives
The following plugins have similar functionality although we have found that _Redirection_, besides being free and installed over 2 million times, does an excellent job
of balacing complex requirements with a simple interface.

 * [Pretty Links](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pretty-link/)
 * [Safe Redirect Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/safe-redirect-manager/)
 * [Simple 301 Redirects](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-301-redirects/)
